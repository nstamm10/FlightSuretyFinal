# FlightSurety2020
This decentralized application allows airline companies to participate in a delayed flight insurence program. Customers of these airlines have the option of purchasing insurance on their flight and receive credit if the flight is delayed. All the contracts are deployed on the Rinkeby testnet.
## Motivation
This project serves as the fifth project in the Udacity Blockchain Development Nanodegree program focussing on autonomous smart contracts, multi-sig consensus, and using external data from oracles.
